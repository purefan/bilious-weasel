Capture The Flag
----

The InfoSec Institute has put a nice series of challenges for practicing skills related to penetration testing and web application cracking.

In this repo you will find the solutions to those challenges. My advice is to try to solve each challenge yourself and only after you have tried _everything_ then look at the answer, or when you have solved a challenge then check the solution here to see if we used the same techniques.

You can reach the challenges here: [http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/](http://ctf.infosecinstitute.com/)
