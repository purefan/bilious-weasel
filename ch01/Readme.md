When we enter the challenge we see a friendly yoda giving us a hint

Maybe from experience but when I read the keyword _"source"_ I immediately thought of _"source code"_, so I opened the source code viewer in Google Chrome (my browser of choice) by pressing `cmd + alt + u` and there I found the flag:

Now that you found the flag you dont need to enter it anywhere, you have access to the next challenge even before you solved this one.
